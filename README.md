# NETS1035 Applied Cryptography Lab 3

1. Create a python program that takes two inputs, a search string pattern and a string to search through:
    - a. The program should take an input for a string with a minimum length of 20 characters
    - b. The program should take a search string input with a max of 4 characters
    - c. The program should use find() to find the number of times a given search string is in the longer string
    - d. The string should print out the number found and the indexes for each string
    - e. Example string “good day, how are you today? Are you happy today? Search string : “day” Final output: 3, [6,19,30]
    - This is an example, I did not confirm the correct indexes, I just guessed.

2. Create a python program for guessing a random number. Your program should use the random library to generate a random
number. Don't show it on the screen though! Have a user input a guess. If they are correct it will say you win, if not
just show what the random number was. Screenshot the code and the program in progress.

3. Finish working on the aes client/server. That means make sure the input from the client is encrypted. Show your code!
    - a. Show the code we worked on in class. Have the first message from client encrypted (sc)
    - b. Show that it is decrypted (sc)
    - c. Now have the servers first message encrypted back to the client (sc)
    - d. Show the code fro client and server and show it working. (sc)
